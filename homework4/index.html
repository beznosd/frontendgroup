					<p> The term “nature” includes all around us: trees, lakes, mountains, seas, animals, flowers, etc. So, nature is something special not controlled by humans. How marvelous and rich nature is!
					Human beings have been closely attaching to nature since time out of memory. In period of paganism people were frightened of such natural sources as storm, thunder, earthquake and downpour. That’s why they made some sacrifices to the mother-nature because ancient people believed it could gain nature’s favour and make their life easier and better.
			<div class="text-img2"></div>
					In our century the attitude to it has been changed. People learned to read the sky, avoid dangerous results of “nature’s rage” and explain all the phenomena scientifically. Now people know how to deal with nature for personal use – they created hydro-electric power stations, solar batteries, lighting conductors, successful agriculture systems and other interesting things. We use natural resources permanently and it helps us survive, but they are not endless and we should not forget to take care about it.

					Sometimes we forget about beauty and richness of nature around us because we are just used to thinking about ourselves and vested interests. You can notice many miracles if you pay attention to them: twitter of birds, sounds of rain and wind, great mountains, green hills and bright sunlight.
					I guess that the nature can be compared with a piece of art or even a master who creates all these beautiful and fantastic things around us. Nature is responsible for our mood and can make us happy and inspired or sad and depressed. Probably, indescribable waterfalls, eye catching meadows with flowers, mysterious mountains attract people’s attention because human being is just a small part of nature and can’t exist separately from it.</p>
